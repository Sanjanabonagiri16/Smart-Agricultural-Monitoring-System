# Smart-Agricultural-Monitoring-System
Creating a Smart Agricultural Monitoring System involves several components, including data collection, processing, and analysis.
1. Define the Objective
Monitor environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and plant health.
2. Gather Required Tools and Libraries
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, opencv-python, tensorflow (for ML models)
3. Set Up Data Collection
Sensors: Use virtual sensors for simulation or collect data from online datasets.
Images: Download plant images for health monitoring from sites like Plant Village Dataset or Kaggle.
4. Create a Data File
Use CSV files for storing sensor data.
5. Data Processing
Load data using pandas.
6.Data Analysis and Visualization
Analyze trends and visualize data.
7. Image Processing and ML Model
Use OpenCV and TensorFlow to process images and build a model to detect plant diseases.
8. Set Up Alerts and Recommendations
Based on data thresholds, generate alerts.
download packages by using these commands:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python tensorflow
